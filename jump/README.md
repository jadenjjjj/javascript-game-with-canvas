\# Square Jump

**Background**

In the beginning I did not intend to write this project, but because my first project because of sprite animation problems, resulting in a lot of bugs, so I had to simplify the project to the project. The reason why I thought of this project is because I like rainbow for a while, so I combined this project and rainbow together.

The whole game process is relatively simple, the player only needs to click on the cell phone screen to make the middle of the small pink square jump up, if the small square is brought to the left side of the screen, then the game is over; in the middle of the screen there is a time counter, every 10s, the number on the counter changes color, the player's square can not step on the rectangular square with the same color as the counter, once fallen If you fall, then the game is over.
